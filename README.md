These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the code. 

**1. Click on the button below to start a new codespace from this repository.**

Click here ➡️  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/skillrepos/copilot-adv?quickstart=1)

**2. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

**3. You'll want to have the labs.md file open (either in a browser tab and/or in your codespace).**

**4. (Optional, but recommended) Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to 60.**
To do this, when logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and scroll down on that page until you see the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.
